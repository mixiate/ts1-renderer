This add-on requires the [TS1 Compiler](https://github.com/mixsims/ts1-compiler) to create the final in-game sprites from the renders from Blender.

You can find out how to use the add-on to render sprites and create objects for The Sims in the [Wiki](https://github.com/mixsims/ts1-renderer/wiki).

Blender 4.1.x and 4.3.x are supported. 4.2.x is not supported due to a bug in those versions of Blender.

## Features
TS1 Renderer combined with TS1 Compiler has many features, here are some of them:
- Render high quality sprites with good depth maps
- Automatically align all sprites, no more manual positioning in Transmogrifier
- Render or rerender your object and produce the updated iff file in one click
- Ability to automatically replace the sprites in many objects without editing drawgroups
- Support for multi tile objects
- Render frames of animation using any of Blenders animation features
- Feature to automatically add sprites for all 4 rotations to most objects
- Render and create new objects automatically for different colors or materials
