TS1 Renderer is an add-on for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) which allows you to render objects for The Sims 1.

This add-on requires the [TS1 Compiler](https://github.com/mixsims/ts1-compiler) to create the final in-game sprites from the renders from Blender.

You can find out how to use the add-on to render sprites and create objects for The Sims in the [Wiki](https://github.com/mixsims/ts1-renderer/wiki).

Blender 4.1.1 is supported.
